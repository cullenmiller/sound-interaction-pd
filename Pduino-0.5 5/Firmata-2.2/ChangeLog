	* .: tagging Firmata 2.2 for Arduino, Teensy, Wiring, etc.

2010-08-09 16:41  pjs

	* Bump to Firmata version 2.2

2010-08-05 20:06  pjs

	* Avoid calling digitalRead() for pins not in input mode. Fixes
	  Arduino Mega conflict between PWM and inputs.

2010-08-05 19:45  pjs

	* Add capabilities and state queries (alpha, may change in future)
	  Fix buffer overflow in reportDigitalCallback

2010-07-20 11:05  pjs

	* Add documentation for hardware abstraction layer, in Boards.h

2010-07-19 22:19  pjs

	* Add extended analog write

2010-07-18 16:56  pjs

	* Merged hardware abstraction branch, r52:57 into trunk

2010-03-20 20:05  eighthave

	* copied StandardFirmata to ShippingFirmata to start working on the
	  default/test firmware for new Arduino boards

2010-03-20 20:01  eighthave

	* started section for firmwares that are not examples and included
	  my DmxSimpleFirmata example to start with

2010-01-05 06:35  eighthave

	* cleaned up comments related to subclassing some kind of Serial
	  base class

2010-01-05 06:32  eighthave

	* cleaned up comments a bit

2010-01-05 06:28  eighthave

	* wrote a more fully featured all-inputs sketch

2010-01-05 05:20  eighthave

	* added explanation text

2010-01-05 05:16  eighthave

	* added an explanation about why this old version is here

2010-01-05 05:10  eighthave

	* renamed StandardFirmata 2.0 to be clearer that its old

2010-01-04 23:04  eighthave

	* created example firmware that acts just like Arduino4Max

2010-01-04 22:54  eighthave

	* removed duplicate line that sends the same message twice

2010-01-02 18:48  eighthave

	* removed duplicate call to send the digital data, pointed out by
	  Bjoern Hartmann and Paul Stoffregen

2010-01-02 18:31  eighthave

	* cast to a byte for optimization, suggested by Paul Stoffregen:
	  "The reason is because portData is a signed integer, so the
	  compiler calls the slow code because it does not know if the
	  value is positive or negative. If you add a byte typecast, the
	  compiler uses a single instruction ANDI instruction"

2009-11-14 00:11  eighthave

	* udpated instructions for Arduino.app

2009-10-22 05:26  eighthave

	* added changes from Hernando Barragan for the Wiring board

2009-10-19 04:07  mayfair

	* modified to support servos on the other digital pins in addition
	  to D9 and D10 (except for D0 and D1)

2009-10-19 00:08  eighthave

	* removed stupid function call causing endless loop...

2009-10-07 20:39  eighthave

	* fixed bug in setting pin to ANALOG mode, fixed by TOF

2009-10-05 21:10  eighthave

	* fixed bug that was setting the analog pins to act like a log pot
	  because the internal pull-ups were on, basically setup() should
	  not touch the analog pins and let the arduino code stay in effect

2009-09-13 04:52  eighthave

	* making one begin() call the other, and moved the blinkVersion()
	  in response to a bug report on the arduino forum:
	  http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1252791964/0

2009-09-10 04:42  eighthave

	* forgot to attach() servos before using them, and detach when
	  switching pinmode

2009-08-11 22:12  eighthave

	* on Zach's suggestion, included an old version of StandardFirmata
	  set at old 115200 bitrate to ease the transition (back) to 57600
	  in 2.1

2009-07-30 20:36  eighthave

	* checked in Shigero's fix for my stupid logic

2009-07-24 00:18  soundanalogous

	* Changed baud rate in I2CFirmata to 57600

2009-07-18 22:03  mayfair

	* modified to be compiled for 328P boards (replaced PC* with
	  PORTC*)

2009-07-16 00:07  eighthave

	* checked in patch from Paul Stoffregen to add support for the
	  Teensy boards,
	  the Sanguino, etc. Ideally, these macros and #ifdefs would go
	  into the code
	  for each board, but it seems that Arduino is not quite ready for
	  that, so
	  we'll keep it here for now.

2009-07-14 15:06  eighthave

	* - added SHIFT_DATA to Firmata.h to claim for future
	  implementations
	  - renamed somethings for clarity and consistency (but left old
	  names in for a bit)
	  FIRMATA_STRING -> STRING_DATA
	  SYSEX_I2C_REQUEST -> I2C_REQUEST
	  SYSEX_I2C_REPLY -> I2C_REPLY
	  SYSEX_SAMPLING_INTERVAL -> SAMPLING_INTERVAL

2009-07-14 14:04  eighthave

	* added pin macros for the Arduino Mega based on its AVR ATmeta1280
	  macro

2009-07-14 03:11  soundanalogous

	* Updated I2CFirmata example to enable I2C power pins to be enabled
	  using I2C Config (see Firmata I2C protocol on firmata.org)

2009-07-14 02:52  soundanalogous

	* Added define for I2C_CONFIG and changed SYSEX_SAMPLING_INTERVAL
	  define to 0x7A

2009-07-10 00:16  eighthave

	* minor cleanups

2009-07-10 00:14  eighthave

	* added more explicit instructions, including how to replace the
	  included Firmata library

2009-07-10 00:14  eighthave

	* updated in preparation for first beta release

2009-07-06 13:51  eighthave

	* made the build use the AVR tools included in the
	  Arduino.app/package and added
	  needed libs to the include/linking paths but it still doesn't
	  quite work with
	  new versions of Arduino.app

2009-07-06 13:49  eighthave

	* made analogWriteCallback check the pinStatus to see what action
	  to do (i.e. PWM, Servo, etc.)

2009-07-03 01:17  eighthave

	* - implemented new extended pinMode and INPUT, OUTPUT, ANALOG,
	  PWM, and SERVO modes
	  
	  - switch default bitrate back to 57600

2009-07-03 00:02  eighthave

	* 115200 proved to be too error-prone, so the default will be
	  reverted to 57600, which matches the new Arduino firmware upload
	  speed AFAIK

2009-06-26 23:05  eighthave

	* - implemented and tested sampling interval message
	  
	  - sketched out Servo support, needs testing
	  
	  - sketched out updated setPinMode stuff since there are now many
	  modes (I2C,
	  Servo, Analog, etc.)

2009-06-26 22:12  eighthave

	* switched intenting to GNU style to match the rest of the code and
	  the Arduino standard

2009-06-15 03:24  eighthave

	* first stab at incorporating Jeff and Shigeru's I2C work into the
	  library

2009-06-15 00:21  eighthave

	* cleaned up formatting and used GNU intendation style, which seems
	  closest to Arduino style

2009-01-12 16:09  eighthave

	* copied newest code from
	  https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/arduino/trunk/hardware/libraries/Firmata
	  to move development here

2009-01-09 21:37  eighthave

	* created layout for the Firmata library for Arduino/Wiring
