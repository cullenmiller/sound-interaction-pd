#X text -84 54 The [namecanvas] object allows you to give name to a
ptach canvas (the patch window where the object is). Then every subpatch
\, graph or abstraction can have its own canvas name.;
#X text -72 187 This canvas is named "Oswaldo" by the above [namecanvas]
object. In the subpatch below there's another \, check it.;
#X text -31 322 This graph has also yet another. open it!;
#X text 399 46 What's with all the naming? Well \, you can now easily
send messages to everyone of them... We don't need now to worry about
the patch file name \, it can be renamed and this still works. And
it allows you further options like sending messages to graphs!;
#X text 399 179 [namecanvas] is considered an "obsolete" object. In
its help file it says it's "better" now to send messages straight to
Pd. Well \, it's not that useless or obsolete actually.;
#X text 441 427 And to send messages to canvases \, just put the name
you gave them!;
