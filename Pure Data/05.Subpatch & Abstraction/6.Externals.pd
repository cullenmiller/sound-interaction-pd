#X text 1 75 Some external objects are actually abstractions!;
#X text 1 110 External objects are in folders that Pd can be set to
look for before start up. An external object can be compiled for Pd
as an object \, or just a Pd patch file.;
#X text 3 174 The [sin~] object is an abstraction \, it calculates
the sine function for audio signals.;
#X text 13 270 You can open it and see how it is just a Pd file that
uses the [cos~] function. Also see that if you ask for its help file
\, it will just open the abstraction \, which is common on the cases
of external abstractions.;
#X text 21 378 We talked about list-abs already \, it is another example
of abstractions as externals. Actually "abs" stands for "abstractions".
