#X text -88 91 This concept in programming language allows the sharing
of attributes. Lets see how this applies to abstractions in Pd. The
patch that contains the abstraction is called a "parent patch" \, and
it can pass some of its attributes to its children (abstractions).
;
#X text -89 192 In the case of abstractions \, unlike simple subpatches
\, they are actual different Pd files. You insert it as an object and
write the name of the file in it to load it. Therefore \, different
abstractons with the same name will contain the same code (as they
aree the same file).;
#X text -86 286 The abstraction won't be loaded if it has the same
name of another loaded pd object (native or external) \, which will
be loaded instead.;
#X text -84 351 Abstractions can inherit values from a parent patch
when they have dollarsign into objects.;
