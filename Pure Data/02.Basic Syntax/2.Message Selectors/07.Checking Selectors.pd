#X text 27 33 Again: Selectors are the first atom in a message. They
specify what type of message it is. Some selectors are implicit. There
are basically 4 Types of Data (or messages/selectors) in Pure Data.
They are: "float" \, "symbol" \, "list" & "bang".;
#X text 26 167 Remember that atom boxes complained when they were given
types of messages they don't deal with. Objects (and not only them)
do that too. So when something receives a message in Pd \, the first
thing it does is check its selector to see what type of data that is
\, and if it works with it.;
#X text 27 280 If an object gets a type of data it doesn't deal with
- like a "float" for example - a common error Pd gives us is: No Method
for 'float'.;
#X text 29 337 Another common error is: expected 'list' but got 'float'.

#X text 32 605 The help files of each object will usually tell you
what type of data it works with. Sometimes is just obvious like above.
