#X text 38 -81 The [image] object loads an image into a patch. This
is merely aesthetical and useful for user friendly interfaces.;
#X text 88 -31 It works with .gif \, .ppm \, & .pgm;
#X text 51 14 Below we have [image ../files/vinil.gif] loading this
image file at the specified folder location.;
#X text 52 62 As usual \, if the file was on the same folder \, there'd
be no need for dots and slashes.;
#X text 517 -176 The object itself is never visible on the patch \,
the best way to find it is selecting a nice area around where you think
it is. Below we have this object with no arguments but with messages
conected to it. See that it also understands the open command. It's
interesting that it will remember the last open command \, so if you
save the patch \, the last opened image will be there.;
